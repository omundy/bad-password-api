<!-- 
Note: The README instructions are the same across the two projects... 

Moving from Glitch to Github:
- You can't have a forked repo and the original in the same account. 
- You can't sync a fork of a template repo with the original.
- So, in order for -starter to be a fork of the original (to sync w/it), the original repo is under omundy/ and -starter (template) is under criticalwebdesign/ 
-->

A password generator that outputs only terrible, regrettable, unacceptable, dreadful, awful, unusable passwords. 

- Use the frontend at [bad-password-api.vercel.app](https://bad-password-api.vercel.app/)
- Or, follow instructions at the link above to connect to the API from your own app.
